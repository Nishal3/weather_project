## Temperature Changes
The temperature also had quite a lot of changes throughout the week. As can be seen, the temperature also somewhat resembles a sine or cosine graph. The temperature also slowly increases and reaches 70 degrees Fahrenheit at its peak.  
The temperature gets chilly at night, which is probably the cause for why the temperature is going up and down.
