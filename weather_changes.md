# Analyzing data from weather data

## Humidity Changes
I collected data of humidity through a week of gathering data and the humidity had fluctuations similar to a sine or cosine graph, and it ended up increasing towards the end of the time frame.

## Temperature Changes
The temperature also had quite a lot of changes throughout the week. As can be seen, the temperature also somewhat resembles a sine or cosine graph. The temperature also slowly goes up reaching 70 degrees farenheit at its peak.  
The temperature goes down at night that is probably the reason why the temperature can be seen going up and down.
