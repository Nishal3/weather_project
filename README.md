## Use Cases
### Humidity
The humidity affects construction with cement; a higher humidity is more suitable for the concrete as it dries. Thus, if the data-gathering procedure is lengthy, regression could be used to predict humidity fluctuations and which days are best to use concrete.

### Temperature
Quite a lot of things are affected by the temperature: one can be when to vend clothes. When it's warmer, people want less bulky clothing, and vice versa when it is chilly. Data on temperature can be used in unison with data on customer consumption to see what people want and when they want it.

Another use-case is when to advertise sports equipment. When advertising sports equipment in the summer, leveraging the data on temperature to see when people are most active can be used to see when people buy equipment most frequently.

### Sunrise & Sunset Times
